Hi there,

Your customer and company data has been imported into Savio. You'll now be able to pick from a list of these customers when you add feedback from inside Savio or from the browser extension.

And when you track a customer's feedback, you'll see their revenue and plan alongside their feedback and the features they've requested.  Which is super handy when deciding what features to build next.  

Happy feedback collecting,

Ryan + Kareem
Savio's Co-Founders
