Hi {{first_name}},

(I hate automated emails too, but replies to these are literally my favorite emails to get.  Even better than the forwards from my mom ðŸ˜„)

Saw you signed up for Savio - I'm a co-founder and personally greet and help everybody who signs up.

Can you do me a favour?  It would really help our two-person startup if you hit "reply" and answer one question:

Why did you sign up for Savio?

I'm asking because knowing why you signed up helps us deliver on what you want.  

Just hit reply and let me know.

Thanks {{first_name}},

Kareem

PS> If Savio's not a fit for you, it would be helpful to understand why not.  Please be brutally honest, my feelings won't be hurt!
